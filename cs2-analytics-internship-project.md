## 2. Project Concept

### CS2 Pro Scene Analytics Platform

A **full-stack data engineering and analytics project** built around Counter-Strike 2 professional
esports data. Ingests match data from public APIs, builds production-grade pipelines, models the
data in a warehouse, and serves three analytical products that answer questions HLTV.org does not.

**Why not just use HLTV?**
HLTV shows historical stats. It doesn't surface patterns, predictions, or forward-looking signals.
This project answers three questions HLTV never answers:
1. *Which upcoming matches are most likely to produce an upset, and why?*
2. *Which tier-2 players are statistically performing like tier-1 players but haven't been noticed?*
3. *Which teams consistently choke leads — or thrive under elimination pressure?*

**Why CS2?**
- Rich, real, publicly accessible data (Liquipedia API v3, FACEIT API, PandaScore)
- Complex enough to demonstrate real engineering skills
- Domain knowledge signals genuine interest to gaming/tech companies
- Three analytical products that are actually shareable (Reddit, Twitter, Discord)

---

## 3. Deliverables

| # | Deliverable | Skills Demonstrated |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **ELT Pipeline** — automated ingestion from Liquipedia v3, FACEIT, PandaScore | Python, REST APIs, Airflow, AWS S3, Parquet |
| 2 | **Data Warehouse** — Snowflake/BigQuery with dbt models | SQL, dbt, star schema, data modeling |
| 3 | **Upset Tracker** — pre-tournament upset probability per matchup | XGBoost, feature engineering, SHAP, statistics |
| 4 | **Hidden Gem Scout** — tier-2 players outperforming their ranking tier | SQL window functions, percentile ranking, dbt |
| 5 | **Choke / Clutch Profile** — lead-blown and comeback rates per team | SQL aggregations, pattern detection, dbt |
| 6 | **Interactive Dashboard** — all three products in one Streamlit web app | Plotly, Streamlit, live public URL |
| 7 | **Dockerized Deployment** — one-command spin-up | Docker, Docker Compose, GitHub Actions CI |

### Three Core Analytics Products

**1. Upset Tracker**
Before every major tournament, surface the 5 most statistically likely upsets with evidence:
- Historical upset rate when team ranks diverge by X positions
- Recent form momentum of both teams (rolling 10-match win rate)
- Map-specific win rate advantage for the underdog
- ML model win probability vs implied odds divergence
- Output: shareable pre-tournament post — *"3 upsets to watch at IEM Katowice"*

**2. Hidden Gem Scout**
Identify players whose individual stats are significantly above their team's ranking tier:
- Compute percentile rank of each player stat (rating, ADR, clutch rate) within their tier cohort
- Flag players in tier-3/4 teams performing at tier-1/2 percentile levels
- Track trajectory — is the outlier improving or regressing over the last 3 months?
- Output: weekly leaderboard of "undervalued" players — the kind fans share before roster announcements

**3. Choke / Clutch Profile**
Surface behavioral patterns teams show under pressure — the stuff box scores don't tell you:
- Lead-blown rate: how often does a team lose after leading 10+ rounds on a map?
- Comeback rate: win % when trailing 3+ rounds at half
- Overtime record: teams that over/underperform their rating in OT
- Elimination match performance vs winners' bracket performance
- Output: team "pressure profile" cards — shareable and endlessly arguable on Reddit

## 5. Data Sources & Access

> **Recommended stack:** Liquipedia API v3 + FACEIT API as the core (both official, free, stable).
> PandaScore for tier-1 pro coverage. Avoid HLTV scraping (Cloudflare-protected, ToS risk) in a
> portfolio project — use a Kaggle CSV to bootstrap historical HLTV-style stats instead.

### 5.1 Liquipedia API v3 (Primary — Free, Official)
- **URL:** `https://api.liquipedia.net/api/v3/`
- **Auth:** Free API key — register at `https://liquipedia.net/api-access`
- **Header:** `Authorization: Liquipedia YOUR_KEY`
- **Rate limit:** ~10 req/s with key, ~1 req/s without
- **Key endpoints for CS2:**
  - `GET /player?wiki=counterstrike` — player profiles, nationality, career info
  - `GET /team?wiki=counterstrike` — team rosters, region, social links
  - `GET /match?wiki=counterstrike` — match results, scores, map details
  - `GET /tournament?wiki=counterstrike` — tournament metadata, prize pools, dates
  - `GET /placement?wiki=counterstrike` — final placements at tournaments
  - `GET /squad?wiki=counterstrike` — current/historical team rosters with date ranges
- **Historical depth:** CS data from 2000+; CS2 specifically from Sep 2023
- **Limitation:** No per-round data or deep in-game stats (ADR, KAST). Good for tournament
  metadata, roster history, and placement records.
- **Python:** Call directly with `httpx`; or use `liquipediapy` (pip) for the older API

### 5.2 FACEIT API (Primary — Free, Best Per-Match Stats)
- **URL:** `https://open.faceit.com/data/v4/`
- **Auth:** Free API key from `developers.faceit.com`
- **Data available:**
  - Full match history per player
  - Per-match statistics: kills, deaths, assists, ADR, headshot%, K/D, KAST
  - Player ELO / skill level
  - Hub and tournament data
  - Match timeline with round-by-round detail
- **Historical depth:** 2015+ for all FACEIT games
- **Why this matters:** FACEIT hosts most competitive semi-pro CS2. This is the richest
  structured API available for CS2 match-level statistics.
- **Rate limits:** Generous; no hard limit published, but ~1 req/s is safe

### 5.3 PandaScore API (Secondary — Tier-1 Pro Coverage)
- **URL:** `https://api.pandascore.co/csgo/`
- **Auth:** Bearer token — free tier at `pandascore.co`
- **Free tier:** 1,000 req/hour
- **Data available:**
  - All tier-1 CS2 events (ESL Pro League, BLAST Premier, IEM, etc.)
  - Match results with map scores
  - Player stats per match
  - Live match data during events
  - Series and tournament metadata
- **Best for:** Clean, structured professional esports data without scraping

### 5.4 HLTV.org (Supplementary — Cloudflare-Protected, Use Sparingly)
- **Official API:** None
- **Access:** Web scraping only — aggressively blocked by Cloudflare WAF
- **Risk:** Against ToS; Cloudflare fingerprints browser behavior
- **Recommendation:** For a portfolio project, **do not rely on HLTV scraping** as a pipeline
  dependency. Instead, use a Kaggle dataset (search: "HLTV CS:GO dataset") to bootstrap
  historical Rating 2.0 and team ranking data.
- **If scraping is needed:** Use `playwright` + `playwright-stealth`, min 3s delays, full caching,
  and target only static pages (player profiles, not live ranking pages)
- **Data only HLTV has:** HLTV 2.0 Rating formula, weekly world rankings, demo file links

### 5.5 Steam Web API (Supplementary — Limited for Pro Data)
- **URL:** `https://api.steampowered.com/` (App ID: `730` for CS2)
- **Auth:** Free Steam API key from `steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey`
- **Useful endpoints:**
  - `ISteamUserStats/GetUserStatsForGame/v2/` — lifetime aggregate stats per player
    (total kills, deaths, headshots, wins by map, time played, weapon stats)
  - `ISteamUser/GetPlayerSummaries/v2/` — display name, avatar, profile URL
- **NOT available:** Per-match history, matchmaking rank, premier rating
- **Use case:** Enrich player profiles with career aggregate stats

### 5.6 Bootstrap Dataset (Kaggle)
- Search Kaggle for: `"HLTV CS:GO dataset"` or `"CS2 pro match data"`
- Several community datasets contain 5+ years of HLTV match results as CSV
- **Use for:** Seeding the warehouse with historical data before live pipeline runs
- **Combine with:** FACEIT + Liquipedia APIs for ongoing live ingestion

- [ ] `dbt docs generate` — full lineage documentation site

**Deliverable:** `dbt_project/` with full model hierarchy, tests, and generated docs

---

### Phase 4: Three Analytics Products + Dashboard
**Goal:** Build all three analytical products and surface them in a single public Streamlit app.

---

#### 4a. Upset Tracker (ML-powered)

**Model:**
- **Target:** Binary — did the lower-ranked team win? (1/0, filtered to matches with rank gap ≥ 5)
- **Features** (pre-computed in `mart_upset_features`):
  - World ranking differential between teams
  - Rolling 10-match win rate for each team (form momentum)
  - Head-to-head historical win rate on this specific map
  - Map-specific win rate per team (comfort score)
  - Average player rating differential
  - Tournament tier (encoded ordinal)
  - Days since last roster change
  - Online vs LAN flag
- **Model:** XGBoost classifier
- **Evaluation:** ROC-AUC, calibration curve, confusion matrix
- **Explainability:** SHAP values per prediction

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Feature engineering pipeline (`sklearn.Pipeline`) from dbt mart
- [ ] Train/test split respecting temporal order (no future leakage)
- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning with `optuna`
- [ ] Save model with `joblib`
- [ ] Dashboard page: upcoming matches ranked by upset probability with SHAP breakdown

---

#### 4b. Hidden Gem Scout (SQL-powered)

**Logic** (all in `mart_hidden_gems` dbt model):
- Assign each player a tier based on their team's world ranking (tier-1: top 10, tier-2: 11-30, etc.)
- Compute percentile rank of each player stat (rating, ADR, K/D, clutch rate) within their tier cohort
- Flag players where 3+ stats are in the top 15th percentile of the tier above theirs
- Add 90-day rolling trend: is the gap growing or shrinking?

**Tasks:**
- [ ] `mart_hidden_gems.sql` — window functions, percentile_cont, tier assignment
- [ ] Dashboard page: ranked table of flagged players with stat comparison vs tier avg
- [ ] Trend sparkline per player (rolling rating over last 90 days)

---

#### 4c. Choke / Clutch Profile (SQL-powered)

**Logic** (all in `mart_choke_profile` dbt model):
- Lead-blown rate: matches where team led by 10+ rounds and lost, divided by all maps with a 10+ lead
- Comeback rate: win % on maps where team trailed 3+ rounds at halftime
- OT record: wins / (wins + losses) in overtime maps
- Elimination record: win % in must-win matches (lower bracket final, elimination rounds)
- Winners' bracket record: win % in non-elimination rounds of the same tournaments

**Tasks:**
- [ ] `mart_choke_profile.sql` — conditional aggregations, CTEs
- [ ] Dashboard page: team cards showing all five pressure metrics with league-average benchmarks
- [ ] Color-coded — green (clutch) / red (choke) relative to field average

---

#### Dashboard Shell

**Tech:**
- `streamlit` + `plotly.express` for all charts
- `st.cache_data` for query caching
- Connect directly to Snowflake / BigQuery via connector
- Deploy to **Streamlit Community Cloud** (free, public URL)

**Pages:**
1. **Home** — Project explainer + links to the three products
2. **Upset Tracker** — Upcoming matches, upset probability ranked, SHAP chart per match
3. **Hidden Gem Scout** — Leaderboard of flagged players, tier comparison, trend sparklines
4. **Choke / Clutch Profile** — Team cards with pressure metrics, sortable by any metric

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Build pages 1-4
- [ ] Wire Upset Tracker to live model inference
- [ ] Add `st.cache_data` with TTL matching Airflow schedule
- [ ] Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud with public URL

**Deliverable:** `dashboard/` app + live public URL

---

### Phase 5: Polish & CI
**Goal:** Production-grade repo that looks as good as the analysis behind it.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] **README.md** — architecture diagram, setup instructions, demo GIFs/screenshots of all three products
- [ ] **GitHub Actions CI** — ruff lint, mypy type check, pytest, dbt test on every PR
- [ ] **Model card** — `ml/MODEL_CARD.md` documenting features, evaluation metrics, known limitations
- [ ] **dbt docs** — generate and host lineage docs (GitHub Pages or dbt Cloud free tier)
- [ ] **Map meta Jupyter report** — Seaborn heatmaps of pick rates + chi-square significance tests → export to PDF as standalone analytical writing sample

**Deliverable:** Polished GitHub repo + live dashboard URL + PDF report

## 10. Resume / Portfolio Framing

### Suggested Resume Bullet Points

```
CS2 Pro Scene Analytics Platform | Python, Airflow, dbt, Snowflake, AWS S3, Streamlit, XGBoost
• Built end-to-end ELT pipeline ingesting 50,000+ pro match records from Liquipedia API v3,
  FACEIT API, and PandaScore into AWS S3 (Parquet), orchestrated with Apache Airflow DAGs
• Designed star-schema warehouse in Snowflake with 14 dbt models including three analytical
  marts powering original insights not available on any existing CS2 stats platform
• Built Upset Tracker: XGBoost classifier (ROC-AUC 0.XX) predicting pre-tournament upsets
  with SHAP explainability; surfaced as live dashboard page at [url]
• Built Hidden Gem Scout: SQL-only outlier detection using window functions and percentile
  ranking to flag tier-2 players performing at tier-1 statistical levels
• Built Choke/Clutch Profile: conditional SQL aggregations identifying teams that
  over/underperform under elimination pressure vs winners' bracket play
• Containerized full stack with Docker Compose; implemented GitHub Actions CI
  (ruff, mypy, pytest, dbt test) on all PRs; deployed public Streamlit dashboard
```

### What Interviewers Will See

- **Original analytical products** — three things you cannot get on HLTV, demoed live at the URL
- **End-to-end ownership** — ingestion → warehouse → ML → dashboard, all in one repo
- **Production patterns** — orchestration, testing, CI/CD, schema validation, model cards
- **Domain passion** — CS2 + data engineering = rare, memorable combination
- **All the buzzwords** — Airflow, dbt, Snowflake, Docker, XGBoost, without being fake

## 11. Timeline Estimate

| Phase | Estimated Duration |
|---|---|
| Phase 1: Ingestion | 1.5 weeks |
| Phase 2: Airflow | 1 week |
| Phase 3: dbt + Warehouse | 1.5 weeks |
| Phase 4: Three Products + Dashboard | 2 weeks |
| Phase 5: Polish + CI + Report | 3-4 days |
| **Total** | **~7 weeks** |

---

## 12. Stretch Goals (Bonus Points)

- **Real-time:** Add Kafka stream for live match events during active tournaments
- **Terraform:** Provision all AWS infrastructure as code
- **Great Expectations:** Data quality suite on raw ingested data
- **MLflow:** Experiment tracking for model iterations
- **Metabase / Apache Superset:** Alternative BI layer (shows Tableau/Power BI analogue)
- **dbt Semantic Layer:** Expose metrics via dbt Cloud (if using free tier)
- **Discord Bot:** CS2 stats bot that queries the warehouse (fun, shareable)
